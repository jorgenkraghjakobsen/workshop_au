# Workshop Open source Chip design AU - 8. May 2023
``` 
Please try to install as much of the tools as described in install_tools.md

Chip design is all Linux and Ununtu 22.04 LTS is a good choice. 
Linux can be installed bare metal as primary OS on your labtop/PC or in a virtual maschine (VM) on a host OS.  

Windows has put a lot of effort into what they call Linux for Windows subssystem. Your can use that if you cant setup a VM or run Linux bare metal - but it is not recomened. 

I have created a matix room : #AU_chipdesign:matrix.org (element://vector/webapp/#/room/%23AU_chipdesign%3Amatrix.org?via=matrix.org)

Any questing regarding the workshop can be addressed here.
